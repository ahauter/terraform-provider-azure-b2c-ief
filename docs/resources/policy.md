## Schema

### Required

- `app_settings` (Map of String) A map of key-value pairs used for variable injection in the XML policy. Use `{settings:key}` in your XML to reference these values.
- `file` (String) Path to the XML policy file on the local file system.
- `publish` (Boolean) Whether to upload/publish the policy to the B2C tenant. If `false`, the provider only performs local processing (variable injection) and stores the result in the `xml` attribute.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Policy ID (extracted from the XML `PolicyId` attribute).
- `xml` (String) The final processed XML content after variable injection.
