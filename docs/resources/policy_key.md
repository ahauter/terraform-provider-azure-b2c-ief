# azure-b2c-ief_policy_key (Resource)

Manages an Azure AD B2C IEF policy key container. Policy keys are used by the Identity Experience Framework for signing, encryption, and integration with external identity providers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Generate a new RSA key for signing
resource "azure_b2c_ief_policy_key" "token_signing" {
  name  = "B2C_1A_TokenSigningKeyContainer"
  usage = "sig"

  generate = {
    type = "RSA"
  }
}

# Upload a secret for Facebook integration
resource "azure_b2c_ief_policy_key" "facebook_secret" {
  name  = "B2C_1A_FacebookSecret"
  usage = "sig"

  upload = {
    value         = var.facebook_client_secret
    value_version = 1
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The IEF policy key container name. The `B2C_1A_` prefix is not added automatically by this provider! You must include it in your policy XML if you reference this key.
- `usage` (String) Key usage: `sig` (signing) or `enc` (encryption).

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `generate` (Block, Optional) Generate a new key in the key container. This will trigger a new key generation on the Azure AD B2C side. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--generate))
- `upload` (Block, Optional) Upload an existing key or secret. This allows you to manage secrets (like Client Secrets for Social IDs) in Terraform and upload them securely. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--upload))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The object ID of the key container in Microsoft Graph. Use this to reference the policy key in a policy.

<a id="nestedblock--generate"></a>
### Nested Schema for `generate`

Optional:

- `type` (String) Key type. Currently, only `RSA` is supported by Azure AD B2C for generated keys.


<a id="nestedblock--upload"></a>
### Nested Schema for `upload`

Optional:

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `value` (String, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Raw secret value. This attribute is write-only and is never stored in the Terraform state for security.
- `value_version` (Number) A version tracker for the secret value. Omit to always upload on every apply, set to a non-negative integer to manage versions, or set to `-1` to force an upload.
